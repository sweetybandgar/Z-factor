### 1. What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
It is designed for everyone, everywhere. Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes. If you want more details, use [this link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

### 2. How to install it?
We won't be downloading anything, instead we will use jdDelivr, a free open source Content delivery network ([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)) to load the bootstrap libraries.

**Action:** *Copy-paste the below stylesheet link tag into your head tag section before all other stylesheets to load our CSS*

    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-F3w7mX95PdgyTmZZMECAngseQB83DfGTowi0iMjiWaeVhAn4FJkqJByhZMI3AhiU" crossorigin="anonymous">

### 3. Create Home Page
This page will contain only three elements: 
```
    a. the navigation header 
    b. the description paragraph 
    c. the Apply Now button 
```

### 4. Create Form Page
